TITLE "title"

#LUT_1D_SIZE M or
#LUT_3D_SIZE M
#where M is the size of the texture
#a 3D texture has the size M x M x M
#e.g. LUT_3D_SIZE 16 creates a 16 x 16 x 16 3D texture
LUT_3D_SIZE 2 

#Default input value range (domain) is 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (white)
#Specify other min/max values to map the cube to any custom input
#range you wish to use, for example if you're working with HDR data
DOMAIN_MIN 0.0 0.0 0.0
DOMAIN_MAX 1.0 1.0 1.0

#for 1D textures, the data is simply a list of floating point values,
#three per line, in RGB order
#for 3D textures, the data is also RGB, and ordered in such a way
#that the red coordinate changes fastest, then the green coordinate,
#and finally, the blue coordinate changes slowest:
0.0 0.0 0.0
1.0 0.0 0.0
0.0 1.0 0.0
1.0 1.0 0.0
0.0 0.0 1.0
1.0 0.0 1.0
0.0 1.0 1.0
1.0 1.0 1.0

#Note that the LUT data is not limited to any particular range
#and can contain values under 0.0 and over 1.0
#The processing application might however still clip the
#output values to the 0.0 - 1.0 range, depending on the internal
#precision of that application's pipeline
#IRIDAS applications generally use a floating point pipeline
#with little or no clipping
